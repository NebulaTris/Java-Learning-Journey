/*OBJECTIVE: Distance travelled by a vehicle in t seconds is ut + Â½*(a*t^2).
Write a program to calculate the distance travelled by a vehicle at regular intervals of time given the values of acceleration and u. 
The program should provide the flexibility to the user to select their own time intervals and repeat calculations for different values of a and u
